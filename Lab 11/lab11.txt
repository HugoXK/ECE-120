QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab11.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab11.bin.)

ANSWER: The program will add decimal number 12 to register R2, whose initial value is 0 due to the clear operation. Register R2 will be modified by the paogram when it is run; It will contain decimal number 12 (x000C) when the program finishes.


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: Comparaing the result we get when the lc-3 run one instruction step by step with what it is expected to be, if they are different, some bugs may exist in the statement which is just executed. Then we can just correct them.
